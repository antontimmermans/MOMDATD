UIIntroductionText.uitext,You walk through Tarrmouth when suddenly you notice a strange sound. A low and almost inaudible humming noise is continuously present in the back of your mind and giving you a growing headache.\n\nIt is difficult to pinpoint the origin of the sound. Clearly its volume increases when you approach the docks.\n\nThe locals seem oblivious to the sound or maybe they just don't care.\n\nSomething must be wrong here so you decide to investigate.
